❗ Notes
This is a basic implementation meant for learning and demonstration.

Uses goto statements for menu navigation which is generally discouraged in production-grade software.

No input validation for non-numeric values in quantity prompts.

Works on Windows-based systems due to use of <conio.h> (can be modified for cross-platform use).
